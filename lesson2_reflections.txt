What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When the repository is initialized, the files and folders used to keep track of the versions are created.
The creation of the dedicated files allows git to store all the necessary pieces of information in a known place.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place where one puts the files ready to be committed. 
All the changes are reflected on the working directory each time the file is saved.
It is moved to the staging area only when the author is confident that the changes are completed.
The repository is a series of snapshots of all the files that together, at a certain point in time, are working correctly together.
The staging area allows to freeze the modifications of a file, while allowing to do other changes on the working directory.


The staging area holds the files 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I can stage all the files after a logical change. If further changes are done in the working directory they are not saved in the commit.
The logical change coherence is preserved.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Good examples of using branches are experimental features and new functionalities and/or layouts.
The branches can maintain a main version, working as expected for the original specifications.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams display all the structure of the single commits and show clearly which commits are on which branches,
which commits can be reached from any other commit, and unreachable commits

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
